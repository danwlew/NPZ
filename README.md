## Introduction

### Background

What began as a light-hearted exploration into networking concepts has evolved into **Network Protocol Zero (NPZ)**—a comprehensive proposal for a next-generation network protocol. Initially conceived as a joke that went a little too far, the idea took on a life of its own, revealing opportunities and possibilities that warrant serious consideration.

### Purpose of NPZ

NPZ aims to address the limitations of existing protocols like IPv4 and IPv6 by providing a modern, scalable, and secure networking solution. Designed with future demands in mind, NPZ supports massive IoT deployments, edge computing, and dynamic network topologies.

### Scope and Objectives

- **Scalability**: Accommodate trillions of devices with an extensive address space.
- **Security**: Integrate robust encryption mechanisms at the protocol level.
- **Efficiency**: Utilize hierarchical addressing and routing to optimize network performance.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure coexistence and interoperability with existing protocols and hardware.
- **Innovation**: Serve as a foundation for new research and development in networking technologies.

---

## Architecture Overview

### Layered Model

NPZ operates at the **Network Layer (Layer 3)** of the OSI model, ensuring independence from lower layers and compatibility with various physical and data link technologies.

### Relation to Existing Protocols

- **Transport Layer Compatibility**: Supports standard transport protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP) and allows for new protocols optimized for NPZ.
- **Application Layer Transparency**: Applications can operate over NPZ without modification if they use standard networking interfaces.

### Compatibility and Integration

- **Tunneling**: NPZ packets can be encapsulated within IPv4 or IPv6 packets to traverse existing networks.
- **Address Translation**: Mechanisms for translating between NPZ and IPv4/IPv6 addresses facilitate interoperability.
- **Dual-Stack Operation**: Devices can support both NPZ and IPv4/IPv6 simultaneously, easing the transition.

---

## Addressing Structure

### Address Format

NPZ uses a hierarchical address format:

```
XXX.YYY.ZZZ.VVV
```

- **Segments**: Each segment (`XXX`, `YYY`, `ZZZ`, `VVV`) ranges from `000` to `999`.
- **Total Addresses**: \( 1000^4 = 1 000 000 000 000 \) possible unique addresses.

### Hierarchical Addressing

- **XXX**: Continental or regional identifiers.
- **YYY**: National or large administrative regions.
- **ZZZ**: Local areas such as cities, ISPs, or organizations.
- **VVV**: Individual devices or subnets.

This hierarchy simplifies routing and allows for efficient address allocation.

### Address Space Allocation

- **Global Addresses**: 80-90% of the address space for public addressing.
- **Private Addresses**: 10-20% reserved for private networks, not routable on the public internet.
- **Special Addresses**: Reserved ranges for multicast, experimental use, and other functions.

### Special Addresses

- **Broadcast**: Addresses with `VVV = 999` for broadcasting within a segment.
- **Localhost**: `127.000.000.001` reserved for loopback communications.
- **Multicast Ranges**: Dedicated segments for multicast group communications.
